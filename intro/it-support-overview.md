# 📘 Intro to IT

## 🧠 Overview
Learning about how the IT industry has come to be what is today is important to understanding where it's going. This page is a very high-level intro to IT and the history of the sector.

## 🗂️ Key Concepts
- #1 Wide range of jobs within the industry – technical support, network engineers, site reliability engineers etc.
- #2 History of IT is long and wonderful – the first computer was an abacus and now we have computational power that once took up a whole room in our pockets.
- #3 Role of an IT support specialist – the role is varied but includes: managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting, and configuring office and computing equipment.
- #4 Abstraction - taking a relatively complex system and making it simpler to use e.g. using a car but not having to manage or understand the inner workings of the car to be able to drive. The same is done with computers.

## 🧪 Tools 
Converting binary to decimal is pretty simple. Use a pen and paper (+calculator), write out the binary values: 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1
- If converting decimal to binary:
  - Work left to right and input a 1 under each binary value if the decimal number fits in or exceeds the binary value. Subtracting the binary value from the decimal number each time, place a 1 under each binary value you're able to subtract from the decimal value. Repeat until your decimal number is 0.
- If converting binary to decimal:
  -Write out the binary number under the appropriate binary values (128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1) then add all the binary values together wherever there is a 1 in the corresponding binary number.

## 💬 Reflections
- Learning about all the individuals that have shaped modern technology is inspiring. I'm excited to research them more and understand their contributions to modern technology better. I'm also going to watch the film Hidden Figures again, the women in the film were known as 'computers' so it'll be interesting to watch the film now through the lens of understanding their contribution to technology and space travel a little better.
