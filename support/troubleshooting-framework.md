# üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Frameworks for IT Support

Understanding how to approach technical issues methodically is essential for IT Support and Help Desk roles. This section outlines key troubleshooting frameworks and techniques that help diagnose and resolve problems effectively.

## üß≠ The CompTIA Troubleshooting Model

A structured, 6-step framework used widely across IT roles:

1. **Identify the Problem**
   - Gather information (user reports, error messages, logs)
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Observe the system behavior

2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**
   - Consider the most likely causes based on symptoms
   - Use experience and documentation
   - Don‚Äôt jump to conclusions

3. **Test the Theory**
   - Attempt simple, non-invasive tests to confirm the cause
   - If theory is incorrect, go back to Step 2

4. **Establish a Plan of Action and Implement the Solution**
   - Create a fix strategy
   - Prioritize minimal user disruption

5. **Verify Full System Functionality**
   - Test thoroughly
   - Ask the user to confirm everything works

6. **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes**
   - Log the issue and resolution in a ticketing system
   - Share fixes with your team when useful

## üß† Other Troubleshooting Tips

- **Reproduce the Problem**: Can you trigger the issue consistently?
- **Divide and Conquer**: Narrow the scope (network, hardware, app, user).
- **Check the Basics**: Power, cables, restarts, updates, connectivity.
- **Swap and Isolate**: Try known-good components (like a different cable or user profile).
- **Ask for Context**: What happened right before the issue started?

## üö´ Pitfalls to avoid:

- Moving in autopilot - even a familiar issue may have nuanced differences, remember to ask the questions!
- Not starting with minimising the scope of the issue to find the root cause - this can waste both your and the user's time.
