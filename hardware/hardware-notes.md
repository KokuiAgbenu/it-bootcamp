## Key Components

### 1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- The “brain” of the computer.
- Executes instructions and processes data.
- Common brands: Intel, AMD.
- Troubleshooting: Overheating, thermal paste issues, fan failure.

### 2. Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Temporary memory for running programs.
- Measured in GB (gigabytes).
- Troubleshooting: Faulty RAM causes crashes, blue screens.

### 3. Storage Devices
- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD):** Magnetic storage, slower but larger capacity.
- **Solid State Drive (SSD):** Faster flash storage, more reliable.
- Troubleshooting: Disk errors, slow read/write speeds.

### 4. Motherboard
- Connects all components.
- Houses CPU socket, RAM slots, PCIe slots.
- Troubleshooting: BIOS issues, component failure.

### 5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- Converts AC to DC power for components.
- Wattage must meet system needs.
- Troubleshooting: Power failure, no startup.

### 6. Peripheral Devices
- Input: Keyboard, mouse, scanner.
- Output: Monitor, printer, speakers.
- Troubleshooting: Driver issues, connectivity problems.
