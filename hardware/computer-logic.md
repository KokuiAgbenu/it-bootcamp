# ⚙️ Computer Logic Fundamentals

Understanding computer logic is foundational to working in IT support. This knowledge helps you troubleshoot hardware behavior, understand system performance, and communicate with developers or engineers when necessary.

## 🧠 What Is Computer Logic?

Computer logic refers to the way computers process data using logical circuits and binary operations. It forms the basis of all computing—from basic arithmetic to complex software execution.

## 🧮 Binary & Boolean Logic

### Binary Number System
- Only uses **0** and **1** (base-2)
- Every bit represents a power of 2
- Computers use binary to represent everything—text, images, instructions
- Encoding is what helps translate binary e.g. using ASCII or UTF-8

Example:
Binary: 00000101
Decimal: 5


### Boolean Logic Gates
These are some of the building blocks of digital circuits:

| Gate | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| AND  | A ∧ B  | Returns `1` only if **both** A and B are `1` |
| OR   | A ∨ B  | Returns `1` if **either** A or B is `1` |
| NOT  | ¬A     | Inverts the input (`1` becomes `0`, and vice versa) |
| XOR  | A ⊕ B  | Returns `1` only if **one** of the inputs is `1` |

## 🏗️ Logical Circuits in Hardware

Logical gates are physically built into CPUs and other components. These gates:
- Perform arithmetic and comparison operations
- Make decisions in programs (e.g. `if`, `while`, `for`)
- Enable CPU tasks such as fetching, decoding, and executing instructions

## ⚡ Real-World Applications

- **Troubleshooting RAM or CPU issues** often involves understanding logic errors or timing problems
- **BIOS/UEFI diagnostics** may reveal logic failures
- **Motherboard schematics** are built using logic gate principles
